# VirtualChef

By David Luong, Shania Kiat, & Anthony Ibe

## Our Mission

We want to develop an app which helps to recommend foods based on ingredients you have on hand and or your tastes.
Our app would not only be a convenient edition to your everyday life, but it can also become a necessary time-saving commodity in your everyday routine.
With no more indecisive choices when looking for restaurants and struggling when you have minimal ingredients, this app allows you to make the most of what you have and give you new ideas you might not have had before.
