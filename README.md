# VirtualChef

We feel an app which can help recommend foods to you based on your ingredients on hand and/or your taste would not only be a convenient edition to your everyday life, but could become a necessary time saving commodity in your everyday routine. No more indecision when looking for restaurants, no more struggling to find something to eat when your pantry isnâ€™t fully stocked. This app would allow to make the most of what you have, or give you ideas you might not have had before.
